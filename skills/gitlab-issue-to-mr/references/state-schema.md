# State Schema

The automation maintains a JSON state document **per repository**, persisted
across polling runs. It is the source of truth for which trigger-label events
have already queued work, which conversations are still active, and which clones
are still on disk.

Each repository in `REPOS` gets its own document, so issue IIDs from different
repositories never share a bucket.

The document holds only what a poll needs in order to decide what to do next.
Issue metadata that can be read back from GitLab is not mirrored here, so there
is nothing to drift.

---

## Storage

**Primary (cloud):** The state is stored in the automation service's built-in KV
store under the key `gitlab_issue_to_mr_state:{group}__{project}` - for example
`gitlab_issue_to_mr_state:my-group__backend`. The KV store is available when
`AUTOMATION_KV_TOKEN` is injected into the run environment. Each automation has
its own isolated namespace.

**Fallback (local/dev):** When the KV store is not available, the state is
written to a local JSON file at:

```
{WORKSPACE_BASE_ROOT}/automation-state/gitlab_issue_to_mr_{automation_id}_{group}__{project}.json
```

`WORKSPACE_BASE_ROOT` is derived by going two levels up from the `WORKSPACE_BASE`
environment variable, stripping `automation-runs/{run_id}`.

Example on a local install:

```
~/.openhands/workspaces/automation-state/gitlab_issue_to_mr_abc12345-..._my-group__backend.json
```

The `automation_id` is read from the `AUTOMATION_EVENT_PAYLOAD` environment
variable, field `automation_id`.

## Top-Level Schema

```jsonc
{
  "version": 1,
  "repo": "group/project",
  "trigger_label": "openhands",
  "updated_at": 1717200000.0,
  "tasks": {}
}
```

---

## `tasks` Map

Key: `"{issue_iid}:label:{label_event_id}"`. This makes the latest GitLab
label-added event the idempotency key. Re-applying the trigger label creates a new
GitLab event and therefore a new task, on a new branch.

Value: **TaskRecord**

```jsonc
{
  "issue_iid": 42,
  "issue_title": "Retry uploads on a 502",
  "trigger_label_event_id": 123456789,

  "expired_after": 7200.5,
  "error": "git push origin ... failed (128): ..."
}
```

| Field | Written when | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `issue_iid` | claim | The issue being implemented (project-scoped IID) |
| `issue_title` | claim | Used for the commit message and the merge request title |
| `trigger_label_event_id` | claim | The GitLab label-added event this task belongs to |
| `trigger_label_event_created_at` | claim | When that label was applied |
| `web_url` | claim | The issue URL |
| `base_branch` | claim | The repository's default branch at claim time |
| `base_sha` | start | The commit the clone starts from; commits are counted against it |
| `branch` | start | The branch the merge request is opened from |
| `status` | throughout | See the lifecycle below |
| `conversation_id` | start | The OpenHands conversation doing the work |
| `workspace_dir` | start | The clone. Removed, and the field dropped, once the task ends |
| `last_activity` | throughout | Drives the debounce, the two-hour abandonment, and the stalled-claim release |
| `finalize_attempts` | finalize | How many times pushing and opening the merge request has been tried |
| `merge_request_url` / `merge_request_iid` | success | The merge request that was opened |
| `completed_at` | end | When the task reached a terminal status |
| `expired_after` | expiry | Seconds the conversation ran before being abandoned |
| `error` | failure | The last finalization error, after the retries ran out |

## Task Lifecycle

```

Every terminal status releases the clone, but only once the conversation is
confirmed stopped. When that cannot be confirmed, `workspace_dir` stays in the
record and a later poll retries the removal.
